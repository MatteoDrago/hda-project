  abstract = {There is a growing interest on using ambient and wearable sensors for human activity recognition, fostered by several application domains and wider availability of sensing technologies. This has triggered increasing attention on the development of robust machine learning techniques that exploits multimodal sensor setups. However, unlike other applications, there are no established benchmarking problems for this field. As a matter of fact, methods are usually tested on custom datasets acquired in very specific experimental setups. Furthermore, data is seldom shared between different groups. Our goal is to address this issue by introducing a versatile human activity dataset recorded in a sensor-rich environment. This database was the basis of an open challenge on activity recognition. We report here the outcome of this challenge, as well as baseline performance using different classification techniques. We expect this benchmarking database will motivate other researchers to replicate and outperform the presented results, thus contributing to further advances in the state-of-the-art of activity recognition methods.}
