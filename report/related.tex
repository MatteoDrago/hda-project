\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related_work}

\MR{The goal of this section is to describe what has been done so far in {\it the} literature. You should focus on and briefly describe the work done in the best papers that you have read. For each you should comment on the paper's contribution, on the good and important findings of such paper and also, 1) on why these findings are not enough and 2) how these findings are improved upon / extended by the work that you do here. At the end of the section, you recap the main paper contributions (one or two, the most important ones) and how these extend / improve upon previous work. If possible, I would make this section no longer than one page, this leads to an overall {\it two pages} including abstract, introduction and related work. I believe this is a fair amount of space in most cases.}\\

\MR{Note that some of the above fields may not be shown when you compile the Latex file, but this depends on the bibliography settings (dictated by the specific Latex style that you load at the beginning of the document). You may decide to include additional pieces of information in a given bibliographic entry, but please, be consistent across all the entries, i.e., use the same fields. Exceptions are in the (rare) cases where some of the fields do not exist (e.g., the paper {\it number} or the {\it pages}).}
